Some guests dive in with gleeful abandon while the shellfish newbies hang back to see how it's done. Either way, soon everyone is grabbing mussels from the bowl, slurping from the shells, and fighting over the last chunks of bread to sop up the sauce. It's a happy, playful, messy scene that never fails to get the party going.",
	        'instructions'	=> "Pick over the mussels, discarding any that are broken or that don't close within a few minutes after tapping them gently on the counter. Clean and de-beard the remaining mussels. Set the cleaned mussels in a bowl near the stove. \n \n Film a large skillet with olive oil and set over medium-high heat. Add the onions and the peppers. Cook until they are soft and the onion is translucent. Stir in the garlic and ginger, and cook another 30 seconds. \n \n Add the curry paste, brown sugar, and fish sauce to the vegetables and stir to coat evenly. Shake the can of coconut milk thoroughly before opening it, then pour it into the pan along with the chicken broth. Bring the curry to a simmer and let it cook until reduced and slightly thickened. \n \n Add the mussels to the pan and cover. Cook for 4-5 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until all the mussels have opened. Discard any mussels that haven't fully opened after 5 minutes. \n \n Transfer the mussels and curry to a serving bowl. Squeeze half the lime over top and tuck the remaining wedges around the bowl.

	        'instructions'	=> "1. Marinate the meat: Three days before cooking, make deep wide cuts into the meat. Then grind the whole cloves, allspice, coriander, peppercorns, and cinnamon stick in a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle, or blend the ground spices. In a medium bowl, mix the spices with the salt, garlic, oil, 2/3 cup of the orange juice, and 1/2 cup of the wine. Stuff the mixture into the slits and the meat's crevices and rub into the pork on all sides. Tuck the roast into a shallow dish, cover, and refrigerate for 3 days, turning three or four times. \n \n 2. Roast the meat: Take the meat out of the refrigerator and preheat the oven to 400°F. Purée the rosemary, onion, salt, and oil, and stuff the mixture into the roast's crevices. \n \n 3. Roll up the roast into a loose cylinder. Put it in a large shallow pan, fat side up (we like a half-sheet pan), scrape any remaining marinade over it, and scatter the orange slices around the pan. Roast for 30 minutes, then pour in the remaining 1 cup wine. \n \n 4. Turn the heat down to 325°F., pour in the remaining 2/3 cup orange juice, and roast for another 90 minutes, basting the pan juices and the orange slices over the meat several times. If the pan juices threaten to burn, blend in a little water. You want them to end up being syrupy, but not burned. \n \n 5. Test the internal temperature of the meat with an instant-read thermometer. Once it reaches 145°F. to 150°F., reduce the heat to 200°F. for another 30 minutes, or until the meat's internal temperature is 155°F. Remove the pork from the oven and let it rest in a warm place for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing. \n \n 6. The pan juices should be syrupy. If needed, set the pan over two burners, skim off a little excess fat, and cook down the juices, stirring with a wooden spatula. \n \n 7. To serve, thinly slice the pork across the grain, moistening the slices with the pan sauce and bits of roasted orange. Don't be put off if the meat is a pinkish beige; it is safe and so succulent. Serve the pork hot.",

Crème brûlée is really one of the simplest desserts to make. But like French onion soup it seems to be a dessert that many people don't realize they can make at home. It's such a staple of restaurants — it must be finicky and difficult, yes? No. There's no stovetop stirring, no need for a mixer. There are no specialty ingredients or tools involved.",
	        'instructions'	=> "1. Heat the oven to 275°F. If you are using a vanilla bean, split it down the center and scrape out its seeds into the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Whisk. \n \n 2. Add the confectioner's sugar and a pinch of salt, and whisk. \n \n 3. Add a drizzle of the cream and whisk it into the egg yolk mixture to lighten it, then add the rest of the cream and whisk. \n \n 4. Pour the mixture through a fine mesh sieve into another bowl. (If using vanilla extract instead of a vanilla bean, add it now, to the strained custard.) \n \n 5. Pour the custard into 4 to 6 ramekins or oven-safe bowls and place them in a larger baking dish. Fill the ramekins as close to the edge as you can; you do not want a lot of empty space between the surface of the custard and the top rim of the ramekin. \n \n 6. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven, and pour about 3 cups of boiling water into the baking dish around the ramekins. \n \n The depth of the ramekins will control how long it takes for the custards to bake. When using very shallow dishes, with the custard less than 1 inch deep, bake for about 30 minutes. When the dishes are narrower and taller, with the custard about 2 inches deep, bake for at least 50 minutes, and up to 60. \n \n How to know when the custard is done: The custard will be quite wobbly; it should jiggle from side to side when nudged. However, it should not be liquid in the center. It will be barely set, but not liquid. The custard will firm up considerably in the refrigerator, so take it out of the oven when it has set into that very-jiggly-not-liquid consistency. \n \n Very, very carefully remove the pan from the oven, and remove the ramekins from the baking dish. Let them cool for about 5 minutes, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or until ready to serve. \n \n 7. When ready to make the sugar crust, take the ramekins out of the refrigerator and dab their tops dry of any moisture or condensation. \n \n 8. Sprinkle a fine layer of sugar over their tops. The key here is for the sugar layer to be of even thickness. Sprinkle the sugar then shake them back and forth to distribute the sugar evenly. Tap out any excess sugar; you should be able to almost see the custard through the thin layer of sugar. \n \n 9. Move the top rack in your oven up as high as it will go. Place the ramekins in the oven on the top rack, and turn on the broiler. Broil for 5 to 10 minutes, rotating them frequently so that they broil evenly. Take them out when they are golden brown and bubbling. \n \n Note: If you want you can put an upside-down pie pan in the oven to raise the custard up even closer to the broiler. This can help speed the broiling process. \n \n 10. It is traditional for crème brûlée to be served cold. If you like it cold, place the ramekins back in the refrigerator. They can be refrigerated for about 30 to 45 minutes before serving (no longer, otherwise the sugar crust may begin to soften). If, however, you like them lukewarm in the center, as I do, you may serve them after the sugar has set (about 5 minutes).",

The truth is, I could live off a poached egg atop toasted sourdough (with a generous dousing of Cholula) every single day for the rest of my life. It would never get old to me. \n \n Every now and then, however, I get a wild hair and branch out. In the case of these eggs Florentine in hash brown nests, it was an experiment in pantry raiding. What can I make without leaving the house to buy groceries? I've had some frozen hash browns in my freezer for too long to admit and three open bags of half eaten spinach staring at me. As for eggs, pancetta, and butter, those are three ingredients I am never without.",
	        'instructions'	=> "For the hash brown nests, preheat oven to 425°. Generously grease a muffin pan with cooking spray. \n \n Combine the hash browns, Parmesan, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. (Note: for a more 'substantial' nest, add two eggs to the mix. I like them without but my boyfriend preferred them with. Your call.) Fill 8 tins with 1/4 cup each of packed hash brown mixture. Bake for 35 - 40 minutes until crisp and golden brown. Allow to cool for a couple of minutes; then carefully remove from the tins. Turn oven to the lowest setting and keep the nests warm, if necessary. \n \n While the nests are in the oven, melt butter in a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add spinach, a handful at a time, and cook until completely wilted, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove from the skillet and set aside. Lay the pancetta slices flat in the skillet and cook, without moving, until the fat begins to render and the edges start to crisp up, about 3 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside. \n \n Poach or fry the eggs as desired. Here is a tutorial on poaching eggs, and another on frying them. \n \n For the Hollandaise, pulse the egg yolks in a blender for a few seconds. Slowly add the butter, drop by drop, with the blender running until an emulsion begins to form. After adding 1/4-1/2 of the butter, you can start to pour it in a steady stream. The Hollandaise should be thick and creamy. Add the lemon juice and a generous amount of kosher salt and cayenne; pulse a few more seconds. (If the Hollandaise is too thick to drizzle, stir in a couple of drops of warm water until it is pourable.) \n \n To assemble the eggs Florentine, place a piece of pancetta on each nest. Add a pile of spinach and a poached egg. Drizzle with Hollandaise sauce. Season with salt, pepper and a pinch of paprika. Serve immediately.",
